Blank lines create paragraphs

**bold** will give you bold text

*italics* will give you a single italic

***bold and italic*** will give you bold and italic

> will give you blockquote

Just add > and > for each line for multi line block quote


To create an ordered list, add line items with numbers followed by periods. The numbers don’t have to be in numerical order, but the list should start with the number one.

To create an unordered list, add dashes (-), asterisks (*), or plus signs (+) in front of line items. Indent one or more items to create a nested list.

If you need to start an unordered list item with a number followed by a period, you can use a backslash (\) to escape the period.

Code blocks are normally indented four spaces or one tab. When they’re in a list, indent them eight spaces or two tabs.

To create a link, enclose the link text in brackets (e.g., [Duck Duck Go]) and then follow it immediately with the URL in parentheses (e.g., (https://duckduckgo.com)).

You can optionally add a title for a link. This will appear as a tooltip when the user hovers over the link. To add a title, enclose it in parentheses after the URL.

My favorite search engine is [Duck Duck Go](https://duckduckgo.com "The best search engine for privacy").

o quickly turn a URL or email address into a link, enclose it in angle brackets.

# JS Tutorials by Zibusiso Masuku

## What is this file?
 All things to learn JS, biased for DS

## What I learnt? **The CHEAT Sheet**
`// This is a comment` This is how you comment out code in JS. This is an example of a single line comment.

This is an example of  multi-line comment block  
`/* This is a  
multi-line comment */` 

`console.log("Hello World")` What is a cheat sheet without printing the iconic `Hello World`

Just so you know: JS stores all numbers to 64-bit floating points, so this means they are almost always accurate to about 15 dp

In JS there are operators and functions.

Operators just work with the object and functions need parentheses (or brackets)

`const` - operator that defines a constant, e.g.,

`const myName = "Zibusiso"` defines a `myName` object that is always constant, and contains the string "Zibusiso", which in this case is my name. You can also use the same syntax to define numbers.

Unlike R, C or Python, etc. JS stores all numbers under one data type `number`.

Other data types are:
- `boolean` returns the standard `true` or `false`
- `undefined` a very special function that means we have not yet decided what our object is, probably will not.
- `string` for text
- `null` when we intentionally want nothing

`typeof` is another operator that tells you the type of an object. It will return a string.
